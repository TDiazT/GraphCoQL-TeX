\section{Introduction}

GraphQL is a technology-agnostic framework that provides a common language to define interfaces to services' data and to query them. It has been mainly proposed as a new alternative to RESTful Web Services. After being designed and used internally in Facebook for three years, in 2015 they released a specification~\cite{gqlspec} and a reference implementation\footnote{https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js}. Since then, GraphQL has seen a huge increase in their extent, community and popularity, becoming an independent foundation\footnote{https://foundation.graphql.org/} early on 2019 and being incorporated to the services of major firms such as Coursera, Github and Airbnb. Some of its strong appeals are that many REST requests can be replaced by a single GraphQL query and that queries follow a ``what you ask is what you get'' spirit. This means that, in contrast with REST-based services, one can be very precise with the data requested and the response will look very similar to the query.

As recently mentioned, GraphQL has a specification that describes its main components, the \spec{} for the remainder of the paper. This document includes definitions for the query language and validation processes, among other things. The specification actively undergoes revisions, with an open working group that meets monthly to discuss related issues and improvements. These include extending the language to support new features or fix possible ambiguities present in the document. This is because the document is written in natural language, i.e. plain English, and does not include a rigorous formalization of its inner mechanics and limitations.
% There is also a project to define CATs\footnote{Compatibility Acceptance Tests} for the different languages and frameworks that implement GraphQL\td{Not sure if this should go or where. It may serve as a link to "why of GraphCoQL"}.

Hartig and PÃ©rez proposed the first (and so far only) formalization of GraphQL~\cite{gqlph} and used it to prove complexity boundaries for GraphQL queries.
We refer to it as \HP{} for the remainder of the paper. These results are based on two major premises. The first one is that ``\textit{for every query $\varphi$ that conforms to a schema $\mathcal{S}$, there exists a {\normalfont non-redundant} query $\varphi$' in {\normalfont ground-typed normal form} such that $\varphi \equiv \varphi$'}''. The second one is that for queries that are \textit{non-redundant} and in \textit{ground-typed normal form}, it is possible to define a simplified version of the semantics which is equivalent to the original.
For the former, they propose a set of equivalence rules to transform queries but they do not actually prove that their application yield a query in this particular form or that they preserve the query semantics. The latter is also exploited, without providing any correctness proof. Since both are fundamental for their complexity results, we believe they must be rigorously addressed.

%We will refer to it as \HP{} throughout the paper. They define the semantics of GraphQL by using a graph as the underlying data model over which queries are evaluated. \td{rewrite} define the normalization transformation, which results in \textit{non-redundant} queries in \textit{ground-typed normal form}.
% This normalization process is essential for proving complexity boundaries for GraphQL queries, because it allows simplifying the semantics and.

On another note, we believe that GraphQL is still a very young and active technology which could greatly benefit by having its specification mechanically verified from its early stages. It has a very active and growing community, with many different implementations in different programming languages and technologies, and more importantly, with many open questions and issues. It currently has a reference implementation, written in Javascript, that could be improved by introducing a formally and mechanically verified one. %We refer to the reference implementation as \textit{GraphQLJs} throughout the document.

 Given the previous factors, we implement \textit{GraphCoQL}\footnote{The ``CoQ'' part is pronounced as ``Coq'', not pronouncing the ``Q'' separately as in ``GraphQL''.}, which formalizes GraphQL in Coq. We believe that it can serve as a starting point towards fully formalizing GraphQL and extracting it to be its official reference implementation.  Transformations over queries, such as \HP{}'s normalization, can then be completely specified and proven correct, as well as possible extensions and optimizations made to the language and its algorithms. To address the trustworthiness of our implementation, GraphCoQL tries to match the \spec{}'s definitions whenever possible. This provides a component of trustworthiness given by an eyeball correspondence, following the examples of~\cite{jscert} and\cite{coqr}.

 % We also test our implementation with examples from the \spec{} but a more thorough comparison should be made against \textit{GraphQLJs} and a bigger test suite.

With respect to the semantics of GraphQL, we follow a mixed approach between the \spec{} and \HP{}. The semantics are defined in a graph setting, as is in \HP{}, but the algorithm can be traced more closely to the \spec{}'s. One of the biggest difference between both approaches (besides the graph model) is that the \spec{} performs a processing of queries during the evaluation, while \HP{} performs a post-processing of the responses generated. We took the mixed approach, which brings out some benefits as well as some limitations, which we discuss further in a following section.

%\td{Rewrite} When it comes to the underlying data model, we follow \HP{} and define our semantics in a graph setting. We are also interested in defining the properties and transformation rules defined by \HP{}. These definitions and their proofs of correctness are fundamental in the posterior results they obtain. This served as a particularly interesting first case study for our system, to establish that we can actually reason about GraphQL and that theirs results were based off correct assumptions. This allows us to, hopefully, anticipate that other transformations may also be defined and proven correct in GraphCoQL.

Finally, regarding the development itself, we made heavy use of SSReflect and their mindset of using boolean reflection as much as possible. Also, the use of the \textit{Equations}\footnote{http://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/} library to define non-structural recursive functions is essential for our definitions. Other libraries, such as \textit{Function} and \textit{Program} did not provide sufficient tools to handle rewriting and inductive reasoning about our definitions, which \textit{Equations} incredibly facilitates. \coql{} is not currently extracted to other languages but we believe that it should not be a difficult task, given the design decisions considered.

%We were first motivated to use it to define the data model and try to narrow our scope to finite types, as was used by (Veronique, Ev, Emilio, Dumbrava). In the end, we did not use any of it but the computational aspect of SSReflect was kept, as it facilitated developing the proofs. This same element is what makes us believe that extraction should not be hard.

\subsubsection*{Contributions}
The main contributions of this work are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first mechanized formalization of GraphQL, including the definition for schema's DSL, query definition, schema and query validation, and its semantics over a graph data model.
    \item Detection and correction of unsound definitions in \HP{}.
    \item The implementation of a normalization function with proofs of its correctness and preservation of semantics. This is a result used by \HP{} to prove complexity boundaries about GraphQL queries.
    \item Proof of equivalence between the semantics and a simplified version. This is also an important result for posterior analysis made in \HP{}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Structure of this paper}

We first begin by gently and briefly introducing GraphQL in Section \ref{sec:bg}, which we do by means of an example. Then, in Section \ref{sec:form}, we describe the basic building blocks of our Coq formalization. This includes the definition of a GraphQL schema, the graph data model, queries and their semantics. Section \ref{sec:norm} describes the normalization process and proofs of its correctness and preservation of semantics. We finalize that section with the definition of the simplified semantics, as described in \HP{}, and a proof of equivalence between the semantics defined in Section \ref{sec:form} and the simplified one. In Section \ref{sec:valid}, we describe some of the work we did to validate our implementation and finally Section \ref{sec:related} and \ref{sec:future} we discuss related and future work.\td{include note on code as anonymous supplementary material}
