\section{Normalization}


\subsection{Ground-typed form}
Describe how it was formalized and differences wrt. the 
formalization by J\&O (ground form using information on type in context).

\subsection{Non-redundancy}
Describe how it was formalized and differences wrt. the
formalization by J\&O (non-redundancy can be weakened).

\subsection{Normalization procedure}

Describe normalization procedure and compare to rules defined by J\&O

\subsection{Normalization theorem}

Describe normalization proof. 

\subsection{Simplified semantics}
Describe the simplified semantics and shouw that it coincides with the ordinary semantics for queries already in normal form.
