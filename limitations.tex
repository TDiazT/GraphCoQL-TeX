\section{Limitations}\label{sec:limitations}

We briefly mention the features that are not currently implemented in \gcoql. 
Each feature will point to the corresponding section or sections in~\cite{gqlspec} where they are defined.

To begin with, the missing executable definitions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mutations (\cf\S2.3).
	\item Subscriptions (\cf\S2.3).
	\item Fragments (\cf\S2.8).\td{This is different from inline fragments !}
\end{itemize}

Regarding the possible operations and definitions on types, the following are not defined.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-null types (\cf\S2.11, 3.4.1, 3.12). 
	\item Type System extensions, either schema or type extensions (\cf\S3.2.2, 3.4.3).
	\item Arguments default values (\cf\S3.6.1).
	\item Input object types (\cf\S3.10).
	\item Directives (\cf\S3.13) 
\end{itemize}
\td{There are directive definitions (which fall into type definition) and directive usage (which are in selections...)}

Then, the features related to queries and their execution that are not currently supported.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Input object values (\cf\S2.9.8).
	\item Variables (\cf\S2.10).
	\item Variables and arguments coercion (\cf\S6.1.2, 6.4.1).
	\item Normal and serial execution (\cf\S6.3.1)
	\item Error handling (\cf\S6.4.4). 
\end{itemize}

Finally, there is nothing on the \textit{Introspection} (\cf\S4) system.
